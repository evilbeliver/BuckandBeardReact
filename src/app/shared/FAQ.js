      question: "What are the member expectations?",
      answer: "All members must provide 1 all-weather stand. Additional stands may be provided.  All personally owned stands must be approved by the officers.  They remain the property of the owner, who is responsible for its on-going maintenance for safety and use by all members and guests. All members are required to participate in 6 scheduled work days, which are all scheduled on Saturdays.  Typically, work days begin early morning and we wrap up around noon.  Should there be circumstances that prevent Saturday workdays, members can coordinate make up days, including during the week. Know, understand and abide by the rules set forth by the SCDNR and the Rules and Regulations of the Buck and Beard Hunting Club."

      question: "Do you follow QDMA guidlines",
      answer: "We do not, we do have a 100 lb. minimum weight restriction on all properties.

All of our other properties have a 6 pt. minimum and a recommended 12â€³ minimum inside spread."
